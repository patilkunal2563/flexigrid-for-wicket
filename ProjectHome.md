# Flexigrid for Wicket #
**Flexigrid for Wicket** brings the popular jQuery plugin **Flexigrid** to the popular Java web framework **Apache Wicket**.

And it does so without requiring you to extend your Apache Wicket application from a custom class or configure any run-time parameters.

And better yet, its extremely easy to use API hides away the complexity of reading Flexigrid's request parameters and writing a response back to it.

Don't you wish all things in life were as simple?
